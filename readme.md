# Full Stack Project by Marco Antonio Bustillos Quiroz
This project contains two main components: an API and a frontend application. Below is a description of the main folders and files in the project.

## Project Structure

- **games-api**: This folder contains the API developed with Node.js and Express. The API handles backend requests and provides the necessary endpoints for the frontend application.

- **games-app**: This folder contains the frontend application developed with Angular 19. The application consumes the endpoints provided by the API and presents the user interface.

- **Games API.postman_collection.json**: This file is a Postman collection that includes all the backend endpoints. You can import this collection into Postman to test the API endpoints.
